# Bin2Deci

**#100DaysOfSwift:** [Day 1, Day 2]

## Day 1
Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This programme follows these constraints in Version 1:

- Return any binary input's in decimal value.
- I use an array to accomplish this in the first version.
- The user can enter a variable number of digits.
- User is not notified when numbers aren't 0's or 1's.

In Version 2:

-   Arrays not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user.
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
    sequence is calculated using a single mathematical function.

## User Stories

-   [x] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
-   [x] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
-   [x] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

## Bonus features

-   [x] User can enter a variable number of binary digits
-  

## Day 2
Bin2Dec now allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent. It also allows
the reverse; allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 decimal digits in any sequence 
and then displays its binary equivalent

- Added segmented control element to allow 

## User Stories

-   [x] User can toggle between changing from binary to decimal or from decimal to binary.
-   [x] User can receives the right conversion at output.
-   [x] User can input any integer in the text field.
